# CS214-Profect-3-Disassemble-and-diffuse-Binary-Bomb

Summary:

The bombs were constructed specifically for the Linux operating system. You must do this assignment on the iLab machines. You will not defuse the bomb otherwise and will not get credit.

In fact, there is a rumor that Dr. Evil has ensured the bomb will always blow up if run elsewhere. There are several other tamper-proofing devices built into the bomb as well, or so they say.

The bomb has 9 phases. The phases get progressively harder to defuse, but the expertise you gain as you move from phase to phase should offset this difficulty.
